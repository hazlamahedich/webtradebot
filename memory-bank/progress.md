## Current Status
We have completed Phase 4 (Launch) by setting up comprehensive documentation, testing infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, and deployment configuration. We've also implemented the initial version of the Documentation Generator feature, which represents progress into Phase 2. Most recently, we've added several key enhancements to the Documentation Generator:

1. **Integration with PR workflow**: The system now automatically checks PRs for documentation changes and analyzes their impact. It can detect when significant code changes are made without documentation updates and recommends what should be documented.

2. **Documentation version control**: We've implemented versioning for documentation, allowing users to track history, see change summaries, and restore previous versions if needed.

3. **Enhanced Quality Assessment**: We've created a detailed quality analysis component that provides metrics on documentation coverage, clarity, completeness, and consistency. It also provides specific improvement recommendations and detects missing documentation.

We've also implemented the Automatic Code Review System, which is a core feature from Phase 2:

1. **GitHub Webhook Integration**: The system automatically captures pull request events (opened and synchronized) and triggers code reviews without user intervention.

2. **Intelligent Code Analysis**: PRs are analyzed using a LangGraph workflow that examines code changes and provides comprehensive feedback on bugs, improvements, and best practices.

3. **Automated Review Comments**: When a review is completed, the system automatically posts a detailed comment to the GitHub PR with the analysis results, making it easy for developers to see feedback directly in their workflow.

4. **Review Status Tracking**: The system tracks the status of reviews in the database, allowing for visibility into the review process and support for retry/recovery of failed reviews.

We're continuing to focus on completing Phase 1 (Foundation) elements for the core application workflow before implementing other Phase 2 and Phase 3 features.

## Known Issues
- Need to complete GitHub OAuth configuration
