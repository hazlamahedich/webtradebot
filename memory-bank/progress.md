# iDocument: Progress Tracker

## What Works
- Project initialization with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui component library configuration
- Basic dependency installation
- Environment variable structure
- Memory bank documentation
- Documentation for users, developers, and deployment
- Testing setup with Jest
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Docker configuration for containerized deployment
- Monitoring setup with Sentry
- Documentation Generator feature (initial implementation)
  - LangGraph workflow for code analysis and documentation generation
  - UI for submitting documentation requests
  - Documentation viewer with component breakdown
  - Supabase schema for documentation storage
  - API endpoints for documentation operations
- Vercel Deployment Optimization
  - Edge Runtime configuration for longer-running operations
  - Chunked processing for AI workflows
  - Webhook-based background processing
  - AI response caching in Supabase
  - Tiered model selection for different contexts
  - Progressive loading architecture

## In Progress
- Setting up NextAuth.js with GitHub OAuth
- Creating the Supabase database schema
- Building the basic UI layout
- Implementing core application pages
- Setting up the LangChain infrastructure
- Enhancing Documentation Generator with quality metrics
- Integrating Documentation Generator with PR workflow
- Testing the edge-optimized processing system
- Implementing client-side streaming UI

## What's Left to Build
### Phase 1 (Foundation)
- GitHub OAuth integration
- User authentication flow
- Basic dashboard layout
- Database schema implementation
- Repository connection interface
- Complete serverless optimization testing

### Phase 2 (Core Features)
- GitHub repository integration
- Pull request fetching and display
- LangGraph code review workflow
- Review suggestion display
- User dashboard
- Documentation Generator enhancements:
  - Documentation quality scoring
  - Missing documentation detection
  - Documentation improvement suggestions
  - Documentation version control
- Edge-optimized LangGraph workflows
- Client-side streaming for progressive loading

### Phase 3 (Enhancement)
- Team collaboration features
- Analytics and insights
- Advanced review options
- UI/UX improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced Documentation Generator features: ✅
  - Diagram generation ✅
  - Advanced search capabilities ✅
  - Documentation export in multiple formats ✅
  - Integration with PR workflow ✅
- Enhanced caching strategies
- Fallback mechanisms for processing failures

### Phase 4 (Launch) - ✅ Completed
- Documentation ✅
- Testing suite ✅
- CI/CD pipeline ✅
- Monitoring and logging ✅
- Production deployment ✅
- Vercel deployment optimization ✅

## Current Status
We have completed Phase 4 (Launch) by setting up comprehensive documentation, testing infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, and deployment configuration. We've also implemented the initial version of the Documentation Generator feature, which represents progress into Phase 2. We're continuing to focus on completing Phase 1 (Foundation) elements for the core application workflow before enhancing the Documentation Generator and implementing other Phase 2 and Phase 3 features.

Most recently, we've optimized the application for deployment on Vercel's free tier by implementing Edge Runtime support, chunked processing for AI operations, webhook-based background jobs, response caching, and tiered model selection. These optimizations allow us to work within the constraints of serverless functions while maintaining robust AI capabilities.

## Known Issues
- Need to complete GitHub OAuth configuration
- Database schema needs to be fully defined
- LangGraph workflow architecture to be further refined
- UI layout needs to be implemented
- Authentication flow to be completed
- Documentation Generator quality metrics need implementation
- Documentation diagrams generation needs improvement
- Chunked processing needs comprehensive testing
- Edge function cold starts may cause initial latency
- Need to implement monitoring for background jobs
