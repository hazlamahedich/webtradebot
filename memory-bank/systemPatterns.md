# iDocument: System Patterns

## System Architecture
iDocument follows a modern web application architecture:
1. **Next.js App Router**: Server-first approach with React Server Components
2. **API Layer**: Next.js API routes with Edge Runtime for long-running operations
3. **Database Layer**: Supabase for data storage, caching, and real-time updates
4. **AI Processing Layer**: LangChain and LangGraph for code analysis and documentation generation
5. **GitHub Integration Layer**: API communication for repository access
6. **Edge Processing Layer**: Optimized AI routines for serverless environment

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Server Components**: Using React Server Components for improved performance
2. **Edge Compatibility**: Designing for deployment on edge networks
3. **Token Handling**: Secure management of GitHub tokens with NextAuth
4. **Real-time Updates**: Leveraging Supabase real-time capabilities for collaborative features
5. **LLM Optimizations**: Structuring prompts and context for efficient AI processing
6. **Parallel AI Workflows**: Separate LangGraph workflows for different AI features (code review, documentation)
7. **Chunked Processing**: Breaking AI tasks into smaller units to work within serverless constraints
8. **Progressive Loading**: Streaming responses to show results as they're generated

## Design Patterns
1. **Feature-based Organization**: Code organized by feature rather than technical role
2. **Server Actions**: Using Next.js server actions for form submissions
3. **State Management**: Combination of React Context and server-side state
4. **Component Composition**: Building complex UI from smaller, reusable components
5. **Chain of Responsibility**: LangChain pattern for processing code reviews and generating documentation
6. **State Machine**: LangGraph pattern for managing the review and documentation workflows
7. **Publish-Subscribe**: Event-based triggering of documentation generation when code changes
8. **Background Processing**: Webhook-based continuation of long-running tasks
9. **Caching Strategy**: AI response caching for performance optimization
10. **Model Adaptation**: Selecting appropriate AI models based on runtime context

## Component Relationships
1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - NextAuth.js → GitHub OAuth → User Session → Protected Routes

2. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Repository Connection → Webhook Registration → PR Events → Review Triggers

3. **Review Process**:
   - Code Diff → LangGraph Analysis → Review Generation → Suggestion Display

4. **Documentation Process**:
   - Repository Access → Task Chunking → Incremental Processing → Progressive Assembly → Final Documentation

5. **User Dashboard**:
   - Authentication → User Data → Repositories → PRs → Review History → Documentation

6. **Team Collaboration**:
   - Organization Structure → Team Permissions → Shared Reviews → Documentation Access
   
7. **Serverless Optimization Flow**:
   - Initial Request → Edge Function → Task Chunking → Webhook Triggers → Progressive Processing → Result Assembly

## Optimization Patterns
1. **AI Task Decomposition**:
   - Breaking complex AI tasks into smaller, independent chunks
   - Processing each chunk within serverless timeout constraints
   - Assembling results progressively for a complete response

2. **Response Streaming**:
   - Progressive loading of AI-generated content
   - Immediate display of partial results as they become available
   - Background processing of remaining content

3. **Tiered Model Selection**:
   - Using smaller, faster models for edge functions
   - Selecting appropriate model based on complexity and context size
   - Falling back to more powerful models when necessary

4. **Smart Caching**:
   - Caching AI responses based on input determinism
   - Invalidating cache based on repository changes
   - Progressive cache updates for partial results
